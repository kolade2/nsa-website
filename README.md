# nsa-website
I built a website for a club I am part to assist growing our brand and reaching new members.

# how to run
This is bareback html,css and javascript web application. 
To run this locally, you need clone the repo and go into the index.html file in the templates folder, then simply click run of the code editor. It should prompt you with a message to run it on chrome or safari for mac users. I suggest using chrome. After this, you should be able to see the web application.
